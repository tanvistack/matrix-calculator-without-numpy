# matrix-calculator-without-numpy
This project demonstrates basic matrix operations using pure Python without any NumPy built-in functions. It includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and determinant of a 2×2 matrix using nested loops and fundamental programming logic. The project helps beginners understand how matrix calculations work internally.
